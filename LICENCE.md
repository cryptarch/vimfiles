The `bclose` plugin is licensed CC-BY-SA from
[this vim tip](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Deleting_a_buffer_without_closing_the_window).
See `LICENCE.CC_BY_SA` for full CC-BY-SA text.

The `orclord` colour scheme was originally a darkened version of `elflord` (funny, huh?).
Since `elflord` is licensed under the Vim licence, you should also consider `orclord` under the Vim licence.
Refer to LICENCE.VIM for more information.

Lots of other tips came from many forgotten places on the internet.
I think I'm using them under "fair use" since it's just a line or two at a time,
but if you think I should be attributing you or I'm using an inconsistent licence then let me know.
